                        Further information: 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement <br>
                        In 2018, a mass movement was held in Bangladesh demanding quota reform in government jobs, led by the General Students' Rights Protection Council. The main objective of this movement was to reform the ongoing quota system in Class I and II government jobs. Following the continuation of the agitation and pressure from the students, the government announced the abolition of the 46-year-old quota system. <br>
                        
                        However in 2021, seven children of freedom fighters, including Ahidul Islam, filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging this decision. Finally, on 5 June 2024, a High Court bench of Justice KM Kamrul Quader and Justice Khizir Hayat declared the decision to scrap the quota system invalid. Immediately after the announcement of the verdict, students started protesting against this verdict in various universities of the country. <br>
                        
                        The movement became more intense in July, with students staging blockades including the "Bangla Blockade". During this time, police used excessive force to quell the agitation led to clashes and a student named Abu Sayed was shot dead by the police in Rangpur. This incident intensified the movement and increased tension across the country.[31] <br>
                        
                        After that, the movement across the country including Dhaka became violent and many casualties were caused by the attacks of law enforcement agencies, Chhatra League and Jubo League in various places.[32] At this time, curfew was imposed across the country and the internet was shut down. The hearing date of the Appellate Division was later brought forward due to the agitation.[33] <br>
                        
                        The anti-discrimination student movement gained momentum when private university students joined on July 16. In response to the escalating quota reform movement, the government mandated the closure of all educational institutions on July 16, 2024. Subsequently, on July 17th, students residing in dormitories at public universities across the nation, including Dhaka University, were compelled to vacate their accommodations. However, due to the permanent residency of a significant portion of private university students in Dhaka, their presence within the city noticeably increased on July 18.[34] <br>
                        
                        On this date, a substantial confrontation occurred between law enforcement and students affiliated with BRAC University and East West University in the Rampura area. Simultaneously, students from AIUB, North South University, Independent University, Bangladesh, and UIU staged demonstrations along Kuril Bishwa Road and Pragati Sarani. Concurrently, protests were initiated by students from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh University of Textiles, Southeast University in Mohakhali area and Northern University in the Uttara region.[35][36][37][38] <br> <br> </p>

                    <p class="bdd">
                        Students of the University of Rajshahi using the Razakar slogans on 14 July 2024 at 11:30 p.m. <br>
                        On 14 July, during a press conference, Sheikh Hasina responded to a question about the protests stating, <br>
                        
                        If the grandchildren of freedom fighters don't get quota benefits, will those then go to the grandchildren of the Razakars? That's my question to the[39] <br>
                        In response to Sheikh Hasina's comment, in the early hours of 15 July,[40] students began using slogans such as, <br>
                        lit.'Who are you? Who am I? <br>
                        Razakar, Razakar. <br>
                        Who said it? Who said it? <br>
                        Autocrat, Autocrat!'.[41] <br>
                        Protesters argued that Hasina's statement indirectly labelled them as "Razakars" and demeaned them for advocating for quota reform, which led them to adopt the slogan. <br>
